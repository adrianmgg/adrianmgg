# amgg

## contact
- discord - `amgg` - at time of writing there's apparently no way to open DMs to non-friend users you don't share servers with, so I'll try to (at least temporarily) add any random friend requests I get
- signal - `amgg.01`
- bluesky - `@amgg.gg`
<!-- ... TODO add more stuff here ... -->
